# Flask Quickstart Tutorial

## Day 1 - Steps to Install and Run a Simple Flask App (Windows)

We can create the `app.py` file in the project folder beforehand.

1. Create an virtual environment in the project folder with command `py -3 -m venv .venv`
2. In the project folder, activate the virtual env. by running `.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. While the virtual env. is activated, install Flask with `pip install Flask`
4. To exit virtual env. we need to deactivate it with `deactivate`
5. To serve the app, virtual env. needs to be activated before running `flask run` (or `flask --app app-name run` if the app is not named `app.py`)
